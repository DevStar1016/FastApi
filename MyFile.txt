Warm with nostalgia, The Civic Tours take visitors on a journey that spans almost one hundred years, from the venue’s inception in the late 1920s and heyday in the 1930s and 40s, bustling with showgirls, cabaret acts, and celebrities, through to the 1990s where the venue’s future lay in the balance before its glorious restoration to the iconic venue that breathes life into the heart of Auckland today. Join our entertaining and knowledgeable tour guides as they take you on a journey through the last remaining 'atmospheric' theatre in the southern hemisphere, capture unique photographs and uncover the incredible history that brings this amazing venue to life. Qualmark is New Zealand tourism’s official quality assurance organisation, and accreditation is recognition of a high-quality tourism business. It’s awarded only after our strong demonstration of performance and achievements in four key areas of the Qualmark criteria: Economic, Social and People, Environment and Culture, and Health, Safety and Wellness.", 'event_location': {'title': 'The Civic', 'street': '', 'region': '', 'country': ''}, 'event_imgurl': 'https://cdn.aucklandunlimited.com/live/assets/media/civic-tours-may-2022-auckland-live-320x200.jpg'}]
